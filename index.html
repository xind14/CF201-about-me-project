        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Xin. I was born in China and moved to the US when I
          was 5. I always wanted to get into acting since a kid. I have the
          opportunity to do that now, but alas, it's not quite that sustainable,
          so here I am learning to code hoping to get into the tech field to
          make money. I am a homebody and with this coding program I am in right
          now makes me even more so... good thing I have a lightbulb to mimic
          the sun!
        </p>

        <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>
        <p>
          My goals in life are to do whatever so that I work to live not live to
          work. I'm gonna finish this program, get a job, make bank, and fund my
          hobbies. Maybe travel some more.
